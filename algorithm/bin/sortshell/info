Shell Sort 壳（Shell）排序——缩小增量排序 

An in-place comparison sort. 
It can be seen as either a generalization of sorting by exchange (bubble sort) 
or sorting by insertion (insertion sort).
The method starts by sorting elements far apart from each other 
and progressively reducing the gap between them. 
Starting with far apart elements can move some out-of-place elements into position 
faster than a simple nearest neighbor exchange.
