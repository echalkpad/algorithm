插入排序 Insertion Sort

Class	Sorting algorithm
Data structure	Array
Worst case performance	О(n^2) comparisons, swaps
Best case performance	O(n) comparisons, O(1) swaps
Average case performance	О(n^2) comparisons, swaps
Worst case space complexity	О(n) total, O(1) auxiliary

从第二个元素开始，按倒序顺序依次与之前的元素比较、调换。
与冒泡、选择相同，适用于排序小列表 
若列表基本有序，则插入排序比冒泡、选择更有效率。 

a simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array (or list) one item at a time. 
It is much less efficient on large lists than more advanced algorithms 
such as quick sort, heap sort, or merge sort.
More efficient in practice than most other simple quadratic (i.e., O(n^2)) algorithms such as selection sort or bubble sort; 
the best case (nearly sorted input) is O(n)
