Shell Sort

Class	Sorting algorithm
Data structure	Array
Worst case performance	O(n^2)
Best case performance	O(n log n)
Average case performance	depends on gap sequence
Worst case space complexity	Ðž(n) total, O(1) auxiliary



An in-place comparison sort. 
It can be seen as either a generalization of sorting by exchange (bubble sort) 
or sorting by insertion (insertion sort).
The method starts by sorting elements far apart from each other 
and progressively reducing the gap between them. 
The running time of Shellsort is heavily dependent on the gap sequence it uses.
