Data structure	Array
Worst case performance	О(n^2)
Best case performance	О(n^2)
Average case performance	О(n^2)
Worst case space complexity	О(n) total, O(1) auxiliary



It has O(n^2) time complexity, making it inefficient on large lists, 
and generally performs worse than the similar insertion sort. 
Selection sort is noted for its simplicity, 
and it has performance advantages over more complicated algorithms in certain situations, 
particularly where auxiliary memory is limited.
