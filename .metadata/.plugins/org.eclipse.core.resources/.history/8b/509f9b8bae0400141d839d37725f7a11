冒泡排序 Bubble Sort —— 相邻交换 

Data structure	Array
Worst case performance	O(n^2)
Best case performance	O(n)
Average case performance	O(n^2)
Worst case space complexity	O(1) auxiliary

ex: arr[n] =  4  3  2  1 
数列i in n-1~1个数分别作为基准（例如：最开始为n-1）
与数列第j in 0~i个数比较 -> arr[j] compared with arr[i]
适用于排序小列表。 

Also referred to as sinking sort, is a simple sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly stepping through the list to be sorted, 
comparing each pair of adjacent items and swapping them if they are in the wrong order. 
The pass through the list is repeated until no swaps are needed, which indicates that the list is sorted. 
Because it only uses comparisons to operate on elements, it is a comparison sort. Although the algorithm is simple, most of the other sorting algorithms are more efficient for large lists.
