选择排序 Selection Sort

Data structure	Array
Worst case performance	О(n^2)
Best case performance	О(n^2)
Average case performance	О(n^2)
Worst case space complexity	О(n) total, O(1) auxiliary

每次扫描比较并选择最小项，找到最小项后交换，即将这一项移到列表中正确的位置。
适用于排序小的列表。

It has O(n^2) time complexity, making it inefficient on large lists, 
and generally performs worse than the similar insertion sort. 
Selection sort is noted for its simplicity, 
and it has performance advantages over more complicated algorithms in certain situations, 
particularly where auxiliary memory is limited.
