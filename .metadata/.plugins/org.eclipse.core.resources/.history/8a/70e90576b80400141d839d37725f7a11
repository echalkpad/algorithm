插入排序 Insertion Sort

Class	Sorting algorithm
Data structure	Array
Worst case performance	О(n^2) comparisons, swaps
Best case performance	O(n) comparisons, O(1) swaps
Average case performance	О(n^2) comparisons, swaps
Worst case space complexity	О(n) total, O(1) auxiliary



a simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array (or list) one item at a time. 
It is much less efficient on large lists than more advanced algorithms such as quicksort, heapsort, or merge sort.
