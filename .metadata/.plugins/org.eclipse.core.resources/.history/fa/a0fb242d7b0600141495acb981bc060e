Quick Sort 快速排序 

Class	Sorting algorithm
Worst case performance	O(n^2)
Best case performance	O(n log n) (simple partition)
or O(n) (three-way partition and equal keys)
Average case performance	O(n log n)
Worst case space complexity	O(n) auxiliary (naive)
O(log n) auxiliary 



Quicksort's sequential and localized memory references work well with a cache. Quicksort is a comparison sort and, in efficient implementations, is not a stable sort.
